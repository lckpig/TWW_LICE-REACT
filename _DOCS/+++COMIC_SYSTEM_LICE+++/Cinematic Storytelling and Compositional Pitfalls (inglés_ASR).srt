1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,959
last time we discussed the basics of

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,700
composition the rule of thirds and

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:06,839
simple shape language to design our

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,820
panels

5
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,599
David Fincher and welcome back to my

6
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,460
course on creating the comic book page

7
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,260
as the artist we want to visualize the

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,820
story unfolding from panel to panel in

9
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,800
the most compelling and engaging way

10
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,660
possible composing each panel the way

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,699
cinematographer might plan shots for a

12
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,260
movie using different lenses in varying

13
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,060
camera placement to more effectively

14
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,320
tell the story and how we position the

15
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,359
camera for the reader's point of view

16
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,399
can have a major impact on the way the

17
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,079
reader experiences the story if you want

18
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,620
to follow along with me as we design our

19
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,059
own comic page head on over to proco.com

20
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,980
comic page and sign up for the course

21
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:42,420
we'll have more lessons and go much

22
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,040
further in depth into what we learned

23
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,160
here we'll be posting premium episodes

24
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,719
regularly so I hope to see you there all

25
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,700
right let's get started

26
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,440
I've sketched in three panels and in the

27
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,660
first panel I'm going to use my rule of

28
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,340
thirds and I'm going to draw a figure

29
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:59,160
pretty small on my panel

30
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,780
my upper third just to kind of fill it

31
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,820
out I'll draw some trees and some

32
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,860
background there's a very simple

33
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,600
representation of the panel and this is

34
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,240
what we would call an establishing shot

35
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,740
or a long shot and in this panel we can

36
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,720
see the figure we can see the whole

37
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,460
background around the figure it slows

38
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,020
our pacing a little bit and it serves to

39
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,520
showcase our figure but also the

40
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,840
background around the figure so we

41
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,060
really get a sense of the environment

42
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,860
that that figure exists in but we don't

43
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,360
get anywhere near as much a sense of

44
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,400
what that figure is about whether

45
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,259
thinking or what they're feeling and

46
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,299
what they're doing so from here we're

47
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,920
going to move into a medium close-up and

48
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,479
in this shot we can see much more of our

49
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,820
figure but we can still see some

50
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,619
background and in a medium close-up we

51
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,540
can see not only the face and much more

52
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,860
of the expression that our character has

53
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,780
but we can also see what they're doing

54
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,159
with their hands and while it showcases

55
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,439
some of our background it does a much

56
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,060
better job of showcasing our figure

57
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,280
in our last example we're going to move

58
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,380
into a close-up of our figure's head we

59
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,880
can move into a close-up or really an

60
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,880
extreme close-up extreme close-up

61
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,220
close-up lean to an eye or it can be a

62
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,079
hand or whatever it is that you want to

63
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,820
showcase and using close-ups really

64
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,560
allows us to focus in on our character

65
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,960
and see subtlety that we really can't

66
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,520
see from a greater distance

67
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,500
and these three shots working in

68
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,900
conjunction with each other give you a

69
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,940
sense of your environment in a long shot

70
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,459
then move in on the characters for

71
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,379
action and so we can see a better sense

72
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:21,420
of what our characters are doing and

73
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:23,220
then in extreme close-ups we really get

74
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,720
a strong sense of exactly what our

75
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,920
characters are thinking and get a much

76
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,720
better sense of what they're all about

77
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,640
and you'll notice if you read comic

78
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,560
books or watch movies that you'll always

79
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,360
see a shot whether it's at the beginning

80
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,280
of a scene the end of the scene or the

81
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,200
middle of the scene where we really pull

82
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,120
out so we can see the environment that

83
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,560
our characters exist within then we move

84
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,480
in on the characters and then we move

85
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,340
even closer so we get a real sense of

86
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,200
the emotion behind the scene

87
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,480
finally we need to talk about point of

88
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,160
view in my first panel I'm going to be

89
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,599
looking up at my figure and so I'm going

90
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,160
to see the figure from below which means

91
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,780
that I've got a horizon line that's well

92
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,400
below my panel and that would represent

93
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,200
my eye line my viewer is actually

94
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,879
looking up at the figure when you choose

95
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,280
a low angle and you look up at a figure

96
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,200
or a building or an object it makes that

97
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,780
building object or figure large and

98
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,239
imposing and even looming and for a

99
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,040
powerful hero or for a villain it's a

100
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,560
very effective technique to make them

101
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,360
look Larger than Life in my next panel

102
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,099
we're going to do the exact opposite and

103
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,659
we're going to be well above our figure

104
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:20,159
and we're going to be looking down at

105
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:21,959
them and it's essentially the same

106
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,060
figure just drawn from a different angle

107
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,159
and it makes them look diminished and a

108
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,140
little smaller and it's a way to make a

109
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,879
figure look maybe even oppressed or sad

110
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,620
and it's something that psychologically

111
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,060
can have an impact even if they don't

112
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,879
understand that you're using these

113
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,860
techniques to Garner that reaction our

114
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:39,540
last example is a profile and it's a

115
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:43,260
straight on shot and it gives us a very

116
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,819
stoic solid Wyatt kind of a panel not

117
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,200
only is it important to know that you

118
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:48,780
can create a different emotional impact

119
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,819
using different angles but it also helps

120
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,739
to vary your storytelling so you don't

121
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:56,280
have the same shot from panel to panel

122
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:59,159
to panel which can become very boring

123
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,080
hi David's course is currently 20 off

124
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:03,959
for the Black Friday sale go to

125
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:07,080
proco.com comic page and use the code

126
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:09,540
black20 to get the discount and so an

127
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,860
example of a page done that way what I

128
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,500
have here is a perfectly serviceable

129
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:16,260
page it works the storytelling can flow

130
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,180
but it is outrageously boring and so

131
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,799
let's do that same page again and I'm

132
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,840
going to start with the same panel that

133
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:24,479
I did in the first version It's a medium

134
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,160
shot of my figure and now in my second

135
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,960
panel I'm going to show my other figure

136
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,120
and I'm going to zoom in much closer so

137
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,680
I get a much bigger shot of his face and

138
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,479
see subtlety that we really can't see

139
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,460
from a greater distance

140
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:37,199
and now in my third panel I'm going to

141
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,360
show both figures I'm going to show them

142
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,000
from above figure's got his arms crossed

143
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,520
my other figure is looking at him

144
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,100
gesturing very quickly drawn just to

145
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,960
establish my figures on the page

146
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,300
and so for this one I've pulled out it's

147
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,620
a much longer shot and I can see my

148
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,840
background around them whatever it

149
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,720
happens to be and now in my last panel

150
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,100
I'm going to come in behind this

151
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,900
character's head maybe I'll even

152
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,300
silhouette it and we'll see our first

153
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,280
character and so we get a two shot like

154
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,259
this and you can see that in this

155
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,540
example I've changed up my sizing quite

156
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:11,820
a bit more I have just a medium shot

157
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,680
here and then I've closed in much more

158
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,540
with a larger head and now I've zoomed

159
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,280
out much more here and moved my camera

160
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,780
so you're looking at the scene from

161
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,520
above and it gives you a different

162
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,380
perspective and just changes things up

163
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,960
and then in the last panel I've

164
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,820
silhouetted a head in the foreground and

165
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,820
included both figures in the scene while

166
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,620
focusing on my original first figure

167
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,940
and it just makes it a lot more visually

168
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,919
interesting and you really want to think

169
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:37,259
in terms of this for all of your pages

170
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:39,060
you want to move the camera around zoom

171
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:41,039
in zoom out you want to have bigger

172
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,479
shots smaller shots and juxtapose those

173
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,400
with each other to keep things more

174
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,320
visually interesting and now there's one

175
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,699
other major Pitfall that's very easy to

176
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,680
run into with your storytelling if

177
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:52,139
you're not aware of it going in and that

178
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,120
is the 180 Rule and all that is from

179
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:55,500
overhead I'm going to draw a line and

180
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,360
I'm going to draw an arc around that

181
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,060
line just about like this and what this

182
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,380
line represents is the limit of where I

183
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,419
can put my camera now I can put this

184
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,460
line anywhere but generally speaking you

185
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:07,620
want to keep it to one side of whatever

186
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,720
it is that you're showing and so that

187
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,580
means that I can put the camera here and

188
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,340
look at the scene this way I can put it

189
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,960
here anywhere along here and really it's

190
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,960
not just a line you can call it like a

191
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,759
half a sphere here's my figure and so I

192
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,080
could visualize My Scene all the way

193
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,180
from the ground all the way from the top

194
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,020
what I want to avoid though is putting

195
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,020
the camera over here

196
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,979
and so let's take a look at how that

197
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,960
works by drawing a couple of panels and

198
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:36,120
so in panel one I've got my two figures

199
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,100
I'm looking at it from about this level

200
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,960
and I'm looking directly into the scene

201
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,940
and I could have chosen for this first

202
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,440
panel any Viewpoint I wanted I could

203
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,400
have went directly from the top all the

204
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,380
way to the floor it really doesn't

205
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,180
matter but the point is that I've picked

206
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,039
an angle once I've drawn my first panel

207
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,660
and to make this easier I'm going to

208
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:53,819
make one character light and another

209
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,319
character dark just so we can track the

210
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:58,020
characters as they go into the next

211
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:00,000
panel now in my next panel I'm going to

212
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,860
draw my same two figures again and now

213
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,020
this character is dark this character is

214
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,639
light so what's happened from above I

215
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,860
was viewing the scene from this side

216
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:10,500
this Arc and what I did is I just moved

217
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,900
the camera over here and so visually

218
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,699
what you see is a flipping of your

219
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,100
characters it looks like characters have

220
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:20,099
just instantly moved in the scene as

221
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:22,919
opposed to just moving the camera

222
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:25,340
yeah if you want more lessons from David
