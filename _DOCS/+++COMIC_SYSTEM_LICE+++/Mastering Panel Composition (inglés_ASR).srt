1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:06,399
two key elements to I would say every

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:09,280
single page if you can do it is to have

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:11,599
a full shot of a character who's in the

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,960
panel and a good shot of their

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,160
environment everything else on this page

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,199
cannot show full body Wolverine or

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,080
background like this panel can be a

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:25,680
closeup of Wolverine angry but as long

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,880
as you've got that first panel here of

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,960
the full body and the full background it

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,560
just sets the tone for the whole world

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,160
for the whole page I recently was

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,760
talking to a guy who had me look through

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,520
his portfolio and the cartooning was

15
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,440
really nice but a lot of the panels

16
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,480
didn't have any background in them you

17
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,440
need some backgrounds in here he came

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,079
back to me with those same pages with

19
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,960
backgrounds improved it greatly and if

20
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:48,960
you don't want to draw a full body shot

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,920
what are you drawing comics for anyways

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,719
that's the fun stuff and learning art

23
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,719
and storytelling with Comics should be

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,399
fun too at pro.com Marvel we're making

25
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:59,000
fun lessons teaching you how to make

26
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:00,440
awesome art and learning how to tell

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,920
stories like professional in the

28
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,360
industry so come check it out and the

29
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,119
thing is this is Comics too so you want

30
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,200
to have that action you want to have

31
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:09,920
that excitement in there and you know

32
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,280
sometimes a background can slow that

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,080
down a little bit it's okay to leave the

34
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,159
background out at times if it's a creepy

35
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,360
mad scientist these are going to work

36
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,600
better than a background on some level

37
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,880
they are some sort of background but

38
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,439
they also like give mood and and

39
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,280
atmosphere and portray what's happening

40
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:31,600
where we need it all to you know you can

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,439
occasionally let's say here you can do

42
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,200
some fun stuff with like panels that

43
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,079
look a lot alike let's say before

44
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,280
Wolverine went into battle here he had

45
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,799
to sneeze I mean you can see here these

46
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,799
are very similar panels it works within

47
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:47,200
the Dynamics of the page but you don't

48
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:50,719
want to do 10 panels like

49
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,360
this even with this basic structure on a

50
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:55,759
page you can do so much you could have a

51
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,799
close-up shot a guy walking down an

52
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:02,360
alley over the shoulder people talking

53
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:04,000
you could do from down below now you can

54
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,520
even come back to another closeup of the

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,119
other guy's face this could be like

56
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:12,599
another dude he's angry goes throw a

57
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:15,280
punch punch comes in the panel guy

58
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,120
Dodges it and if you need to do it this

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,360
way start out making Comics this way

60
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,560
just make a nine panel grid and do it

61
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,519
that way as the dialogue of making

62
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,879
Comics starts to develop itself in your

63
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,879
brain you'll eventually get to this but

64
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,879
if you need to start this way to learn

65
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:32,280
there's nothing wrong with that even

66
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:34,160
professional dudes draw this way Jack

67
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,120
Kirby one of the most amazing comic book

68
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,040
artists of all time he's done some

69
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,120
amazing battle sequences that were

70
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,879
worked in the nine panel grid if that's

71
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,040
what helps you out starting that way

72
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:46,120
then I would say do it all the way it's

73
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,519
a great system it helps you learn the

74
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,280
language of making Comics it takes a

75
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:52,080
little bit of the pressure off of having

76
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,040
to think about making it this dynamic

77
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,239
because this can be dynamic too like I

78
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,920
said you got head you got a awesome face

79
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,920
shot you got an alley you got over the

80
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,400
shoulders you got down below you got

81
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,879
another head you got a punch being

82
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,200
thrown this guy's avoiding the punch

83
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,599
he's running away and then let's what do

84
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,319
we want for last panel trips over a pipe

85
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,840
and there you go hopefully we'll

86
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:15,799
progress into doing this but even that

87
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,640
is fun I mean look at that we got this

88
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,040
panel Wolverine's running it's cold

89
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,720
outside he sneezes he gets mad and I

90
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,400
don't know he's trying to cut the tree

91
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,400
down cuz he sneezed but then you got the

92
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,120
whole page like right next to it and

93
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,720
let's say this cuts to the past or

94
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,920
something who knows but then you've got

95
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,120
this panel it's 9 panel grid it sets it

96
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,159
apart from what this is and those two

97
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,239
pages look fun together as the artist

98
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:40,920
that I am I am trying to utilize every

99
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,720
space on the page that I possibly can

100
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,799
cuz it's all awesome real estate I mean

101
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,959
even if you look at this here so I got

102
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:50,760
Wolverine running through the snow right

103
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:53,360
this hand coming out into this panel

104
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,120
like almost tells the reader exactly

105
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,760
where they need to go there are times

106
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,319
when you don't want to use it you know

107
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,599
like this page here it's probably not

108
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,840
any of these panels I can really see

109
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,760
going into another panel you might do

110
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,959
something like even to make the nine

111
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,079
panel grid a little bit more Dynamic

112
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,480
let's say the panel is mainly about this

113
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:14,840
guy I just did you could put him and his

114
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:18,079
shoulders are going off the page here

115
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,560
and he's like oh my gosh cuz the main

116
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,040
point of this page was to show that he

117
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,520
was sad about or scared about something

118
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,960
if you look at it like look you're still

119
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,479
on that nine panel grid really giving it

120
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,199
a little bit something extra that you

121
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:31,160
don't normally see in the nine panel

122
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,320
grid makes it like that much more

123
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,199
exciting and such a fun page to look at

124
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,720
but he's not breaking into any other

125
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,520
panels to be honest we just pulled the

126
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,240
panels away from him you wouldn't want

127
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,080
like Wolverine's fins to go out here

128
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,759
this keeps it like nice and tight and

129
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,880
clean here you're going to find your

130
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,440
moments and you're going to see where

131
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,759
you got little spaces that you can like

132
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,720
bring it over into and it's just all

133
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,440
about that Dynamic comic making and I

134
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,720
think it just really really gives it

135
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,680
that little extra you know when you look

136
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,320
at a page or whatever and something's

137
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,080
going a little bit more into that other

138
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,880
page panel every page is almost a little

139
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,520
Cliffhanger cuz you do you want

140
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,720
everybody to turn the page to the next

141
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,759
page so let's say in the in the middle

142
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,160
of this page you've got a guy picking

143
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,600
his nose you could do four panels of the

144
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,080
guy picking his nose you could have he's

145
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:20,240
thinking about picking his nose his hand

146
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:23,880
starts to go up right then you've got

147
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,280
another panel shot picking his nose and

148
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,560
then we got the last panel got a nice

149
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,520
gooey booger I mean that this is the fun

150
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,720
of comics you know know he's got an ice

151
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:36,000
gooey booger you could also just use

152
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,680
these two panels you know to do the same

153
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,360
thing you know what I'm saying like you

154
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:44,360
got this and this finger going up booger

155
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,759
coming out like I said this is this is

156
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,000
pacing in comics this is like what do I

157
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:51,720
choose to do and and that's the fun

158
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,680
about making Comics I think like I like

159
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,199
I like to do stuff like this where it's

160
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,520
like it's like a slow little animation

161
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,759
of that but you know sometimes you don't

162
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,080
have room on the pap P to do that and

163
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:04,120
sometimes you might send it back to the

164
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,440
writer or editor and they're like Aaron

165
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,599
we don't need that many panels of the

166
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,319
guy picking his nose and I'm just like

167
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:10,919
oh man it's really fun to draw that guy

168
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:12,360
picking his nose you know but whatever

169
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:14,400
but yeah you could do like I said you

170
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,080
can just do the two panels and give it

171
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,680
the same effect and the writer might

172
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,680
only have written two panels of guy

173
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,840
picking his nose maybe this guy who was

174
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,080
picking his nose here like hanging out

175
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,800
in front of a convenience store no what

176
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,639
you didn't show was that like

177
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:34,160
galatis and The Watcher are like

178
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:37,759
fighting and he's down here he's just a

179
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,520
little guy convenience store right and

180
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,639
just add a little love to the story then

181
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:47,840
we close up on him he was picking his

182
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:51,160
nose and then the Watcher punches

183
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:54,599
Galactus and then Galactus falls down

184
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,120
onto the convenience store and that's a

185
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:59,240
lot of stuff you got to show on that

186
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,039
page so maybe having four panels of the

187
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,120
guy picking his nose is not your best

188
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,240
idea but also we've got a lot of

189
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,400
exciting things happening and the pacing

190
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,639
of this slows it down just a notch and

191
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,599
then you're right back in the action and

192
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,479
boom and that's pacing in comics and

193
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,319
like you know there was a there's one of

194
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,080
my favorite scenes in a comic where

195
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,440
somebody has just died in this comic and

196
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,639
the character is really sad and there's

197
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,720
six panels the character standing there

198
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:28,639
bop boop raindrops falling around him

199
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,080
also in those panels the colorist did

200
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,919
cool things cuz there was cop cars

201
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,240
around so the cop the lights were

202
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:37,599
shining differently then you get to this

203
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,080
panel same shot still and all of a

204
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,199
sudden you see somebody else come in

205
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,680
from this side and they've got a jacket

206
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:46,720
in their hand and this panel here the

207
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,080
guy is putting the jacket on it helping

208
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,039
him out and then this panel here walking

209
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,759
out of the shot and the guy who brought

210
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,479
him the jacket is walking away too once

211
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,919
again some you might consider this a

212
00:07:55,479 --> 00:08:01,159
boring page but to see something slowly

213
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:03,360
play out out like this in comics is

214
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:04,840
always nice too you could do it with two

215
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,879
panels we could have probably done this

216
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,479
whole thing in four panels but I think

217
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,879
doing it in six just that little bit

218
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:14,520
more pacing gives it that little bit

219
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,400
more like time to breathe time to let

220
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,680
the characters live the thing is if

221
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,479
you're going to make comics the story is

222
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,560
the most important thing you can be a

223
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:25,720
bad artist and still tell a good story

224
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,199
you can draw Pinups of Captain America

225
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:32,200
Spider-Man and whoever all day long but

226
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:35,000
to be an actual like comic maker you

227
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,240
have to take this writer script and put

228
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,279
it down on paper the reader has to

229
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,000
follow that and know what's happening on

230
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,959
any moment after this check out the rest

231
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,760
